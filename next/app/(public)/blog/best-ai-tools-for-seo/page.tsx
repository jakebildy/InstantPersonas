            Guest posting is one of the best ways to build backlinks and
            supercharge your SEO. However, finding sites to reach out to can be
            time intensive. That&apos;s where AI comes in. We built a free tool
            to find you niche-specific guest posting opportunities with AI. Just
            describe your target audience and we&apos;ll do the heavy lifting.

            Install an AI Chatbot on your Site to Boost SEO
          </h2>
          <p>
            Adding an AI chatbot encourages users to stay longer on a web page.
            This extended time spent on your site sends positive signals to
            Google, which is great for SEO. Additionally, by helping direct
            inbound leads/customers go where they need to go, they&apos;re more
            likely to be satisfied, which means more returning customers and
            increased organic traffic through word of mouth.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            However, not every site in every niche needs an AI chatbot. If you
            have a lot of different services, often deal with customer support,
            or need to qualify your leads, it might be a good fit.
            <br></br> <br></br>Intercom seems to be the most common AI chat
            solution we&apos;ve seen recently. I haven&apos;t personally used
            it, however.

            Build AI Powered Tools as Lead Magnets
          </h2>
          <p>
            I&apos;ll let you in on a little secret.
            <br></br>
            <br></br> This is exactly what we&apos;re doing. And it works.
            Here&apos;s a case study. Another developer and I launched a free
            lead magnet called UserPersona back in early 2023. It took us a day
            to build. We did effectively no marketing apart from posting it on
            ProductHunt. Here were the results:
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <Image
              src="/blogs/ai-for-seo/lead-magnet-search-console.png"
              height={400}
              width={800}
              alt="InstantPersonas Lead Magnet Results"
              className="mx-auto rounded-md my-5"
              unoptimized
            />
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Tons of sites started linking back to our free lead magnet. I
            didn&apos;t need to do any outreach at all. Even today, we still get
            a sizeable amount of traffic to InstantPersonas from this lead
            magnet. There are a couple reasons this can be so powerful. Firstly,
            lots of people can write a blog post. Far fewer think they can build
            AI tools. Secondly, free tools (AI-powered or not) and statistics
            pages are a great way to build backlinks, as they&apos;re commonly
            linked to by other blogs and sites. Another benefit of an AI-powered
            lead magnet (even simple prompt-wrappers), is that inputting
            information and waiting for generation to complete takes time, which
            sends positive signals to Google.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Do you need to know how to code? Not necessarily. You can build out
            some basic prompt wrappers using no-code tools like Make and Bubble.
            If it&apos;s more complicated, you can hire AI developers to do this
            for you.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I want to point out however, that the AI space is getting
            more competitive, so you may find it&apos;s harder to achieve the
            same results with zero marketing. With some marketing, however, this
            is a fantastic strategy to grow your website.

          </h2>
          <p>
            This is probably the most important use of AI for SEO. At the end of
            the day, it doesn&apos;t matter if you have all the right keywords,
            and lots of blog posts and lead magnets if you don&apos;t{" "}
