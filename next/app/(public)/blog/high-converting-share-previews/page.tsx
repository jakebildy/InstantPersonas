            What Is A Social Share Preview?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Social previews or social share previews are what your URL will look
            like when shared on social media. It&apos;ll look different when
            shared on different platforms. Making it look good across platforms
            and using high converting language can boost your engagement,
            helping increase your SEO.

            Tips For Crafting Highly Compelling Social Previews
          </h2>
          <p>
            1. <b>The title needs to be engaging and under 60 characters</b>.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            2. <b>Create curiosity</b>. You can do this by asking an intriguing
            question, or mentioning what they can learn in the description. For
            example, for this article, I might mention “Don&apos;t miss the 7
            steps to make them high converting .”
            <br></br> <br></br>
            3. <b>Negative call to actions are better than positive ones</b>.
            According to Hubspot, this works particularly well for B2C brands.
            Here&apos;s an example. What seems more engaging? ”Learn the 4 steps
            to a successful PR campaign” or “<i>Don&apos;t</i> miss the 4 steps
            to a successful PR campaign.”
            <br></br> <br></br>
            4. <b>Look at how your competitors do it</b>. Start noticing what
            link previews convince YOU to click.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            5. <b>Limit your description to below 200 characters</b> so it
            doesn&apos;t get truncated and is quick to read.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            6. <b>The description needs to capture their attention</b> and
            convince them to click. Read up on copywriting tips.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            7. <b>Use engaging visuals</b>.<br></br> <br></br>

            How do you make a good cover image?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The cover should be a PNG image with the dimensions 1200x630px (if
            you want to optimize for Facebook). It can be cropped, so put all
            valuable information closer to the center. The image should be
            engaging.

            What are the open graph meta tags?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Open Graph meta tags are snippets of code that control how your
            content looks when shared on social media. Every web page needs
            these four basic Open Graph tags: <i>og:title</i>, <i>og:type</i>,{" "}
            <i>og:image</i>, and <i>og:url</i>.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            These tags are important to make sure your posts show up correctly
            on Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and other platforms.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            For X/Twitter, it&apos;s a little different - you also want to use
            Twitter Cards to ensure your posts display properly. X/Twitter will
            still use Open Graph Tags to display your content, but to fully
            optimize your content you want to additionally include the{" "}
            <b>Twitter Card tags</b> (<i>twitter:title</i>,{" "}
            <i>twitter:description</i>, <i>twitter:image</i>, etc.) .

            What does it mean if a preview is &apos;&apos;cached&apos;&apos;?
          </h2>
          <p>
            When a preview is &apos;&apos;cached,&apos;&apos; it means the
            website saved a copy of it to show faster. This helps the preview
            load quickly when shared again. However, if the original content
            changes, the preview might not update right away.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Different sites cache social share previews for different amounts of
            time (usually around 30 days according to Shareaholic), but
            eventually it should update automatically.

            Do Social Shares Boost Topical Authority?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Social shares boost visibility, which means more real people
            engaging with your content and brand. This may indirectly influence
            search engines by directing more traffic to your site, starting
            discussions and increasing your user engagement, and potentially
            gaining backlinks.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            These factors can collectively signal to search engines that the
            content is relevant and valuable, which can enhance its ranking and
            by extension the perceived topical authority of the website.{" "}
