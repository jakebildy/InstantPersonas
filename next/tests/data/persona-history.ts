            '{"business":"The FCS business specializes in creating a framework for system organization and documentation practices aimed at enhancing clarity, consistency, and efficiency in software projects. It provides comprehensive guidelines for naming conventions and documentation standards to assist organizations and developers in navigating complex software projects more effectively.\\n\\n**Naming Conventions:** FCS\'s framework emphasizes the strategic use of specific cases (e.g., camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE) and a logical folder structure following Next.js routing guidelines. This approach ensures clear differentiation among components, utilities, and hooks, facilitating improved project navigation and understanding.\\n\\n**Documentation Guidelines:** The documentation standards focus on articulating system intent, abstract architecture, and blackbox interface, employing inductive reasoning to balance technical depth with accessibility. By establishing clear documentation practices, FCS aims to bridge the gap between technical complexity and comprehensible explanations, promoting a practical engagement with system architecture and purpose.","targetProblem":"The primary problem FCS addresses is the lack of standardization and clarity in naming conventions and documentation practices within software development projects. Organizations and developers often struggle with managing and understanding complex project structures due to inconsistent naming and poor documentation strategies. FCS’s approach to standardizing these aspects aims to make software development projects more manageable, understandable, and efficient."}',
